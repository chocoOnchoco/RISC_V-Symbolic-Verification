Attempting to create xor-swap, which will swap the values at two variables/registers

1st try: p1 is not equivalent to p2 (Reason: Concrete Execution)
This is with using the following dsl:
a = 1;
b = 2;
copy = a;
a = b;
b = copy;

2nd try: I removed the li and assignment instructions, which allowed the two codes to be equivalent.
