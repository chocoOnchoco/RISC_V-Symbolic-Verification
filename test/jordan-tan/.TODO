Create an program that checks for equivalency with DSL and RISC-V "Add" instruction.
Write documentation on what I can build and cannot build.
Write benchmarks for all 
Random functions are not working

One program with all operators together
One program with all shift operators such that it's equivalent dsl uses multiplication
Add XOR register swap operation 

Test RISCV_sample_in_paper

For memory, it is in 32 bit
regSize = ":32" in RISCVtodslHelper.py on line 134

It appears that += is not a valid dsl operator
